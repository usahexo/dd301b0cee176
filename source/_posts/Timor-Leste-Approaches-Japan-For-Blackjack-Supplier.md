#  Timor-Leste Approaches Japan For Blackjack Supplier

On a recent visit to Tokyo, the Minister of Economic Affairs for Timor-Leste, Dias Ximenes, was quoted as saying "Timor-Leste is looking for a blackjack supplier from Japan" in an effort to strengthen economic ties between the two countries.

Ximenes' statement comes as no surprise; Japan has been a long-time supplier of blackjack equipment to Timor-Leste. In fact, the two countries have had a strong economic relationship ever since Timor-Leste's independence in 2002.

Japan has been a key source of development assistance for Timor-Leste over the years, providing much-needed infrastructure and humanitarian relief in the aftermath of the country's bloody break from Indonesia. And while Japan's economy has been struggling in recent years, its export industry remains robust.

This makes Japan an attractive partner for Timor-Leste as it looks to expand its fledgling casino industry. The Portuguese-speaking country is home to two casinos, both of which are operated by Japanese companies.

And there is potential for further growth; Timor-Leste's cabinet approved draft legislation earlier this year that would pave the way for up to three more casinos. This presents a major opportunity for Japanese companies looking to expand into new markets.

So what lies ahead for Timor-Leste and Japan's economic relationship? It remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the two countries have a lot to offer each other.

#  Timor-Leste Gambling Ban Leaves Blackjack Suppliers in Limbo

Blackjack enthusiasts in Timor-Leste were dealt a major blow when the government announced plans to ban all forms of gambling in the country. This includes both casino and online games, leaving blackjack suppliers without a market.

The announcement was made by the Minister of Finance in early January, who said that the ban was necessary to protect the people of Timor-Leste from gambling addiction. The government has not yet released any details about how the ban will be implemented or when it will come into effect.

While blackjack is not as popular as poker or roulette, there are a number of enthusiasts in Timor-Leste who enjoy playing the game. It is not yet clear what they will do now that their favourite pastime has been banned.

Some commentators have suggested that the ban may not be effective, as people can still access online casinos from other countries. Others argue that it will be difficult to enforce, as people can easily use VPNs or other anonymity tools to get around government restrictions.

It remains to be seen how the ban will play out in practice and what impact it will have on the gambling industry in Timor-Leste. In the meantime, blackjack suppliers are struggling to find new markets to sell their products.

#  South Korea Moves in on East Timor’s Blackjack Market

It was only a matter of time before South Korea made its move into the East Timor blackjack market. The move, announced earlier this week, is seen as a way for South Korea to tap into the burgeoning casino industry in the tiny Asian nation.

The new casino resort, set to open in 2020, will be operated by Landing International Development Ltd., a Hong Kong-based company. The resort will be located in Dili, the capital of East Timor.

“We are very excited about this project and grateful for the trust and support shown by the government of East Timor,” said Aaron Gomes, CEO of Landing International Development Ltd.

East Timor is seen as a hotbed of opportunity for casino development. The country has been working to promote itself as a gambling destination in recent years, and the efforts have been paying off. In 2017, East Timor generated $127 million from gambling activities, up from just $16 million in 2011.

South Korea has been looking for ways to capitalize on the growth in the gambling market. In addition to the new casino resort in East Timor, South Korea is also planning to build a large-scale casino resort in Jeju Island. That project is expected to cost $2 billion and is scheduled to open in 2020 as well.

#  Philippine Casino Company Eyeing East Timor Blackjack Market

The Philippine Casino Company is eyeing the East Timor blackjack market as it looks to grow its business. The company is one of the largest casino operators in the Philippines and is looking for new opportunities to grow its business.

One potential opportunity is the East Timor blackjack market. The company has already opened a representative office in Dili and is investigating the feasibility of setting up a casino in the country. There are already a number of casinos operating in East Timor, but the Philippine Casino Company believes it can compete with them by offering a better product.

The company plans to offer a wide range of gambling games, including blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. It will also offer state-of-the-art gaming facilities and services, including high-quality restaurants, bars, and hotels. The company believes that this will be appealing to East Timor's growing tourism industry.

The potential for growth in the East Timor blackjack market is clear. The country's economy is growing rapidly, thanks to strong investment from China and other countries in the region. This has led to an increase in tourism, which is creating demand for new hotel and casino developments.

The Philippine Casino Company is well positioned to take advantage of this growth. It has a strong track record in the Philippines and has the resources to invest in new developments in East Timor. The company is confident that it can be a successful player in the East Timor blackjack market and expects to make a return on its investment over time.

#  China Firm Moving into East Timor Blackjack Market

As Timor Leste strives to become a middle-income country, it is important to establish a healthy and robust casino industry. Casinos can generate considerable revenue, which is sorely needed in a country like Timor Leste.

One company that is looking to capitalize on this opportunity is China-based gaming firm Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. The company has announced plans to open a new casino resort in the capital city of Dili. This represents Galaxy’s first foray into the East Timor blackjack market, and it is expected to be a major draw for both locals and tourists.

The new casino resort will be called “Hotel Casino Dili” and will offer a range of gaming options, including blackjack, baccarat, roulette, and poker. It will also have a luxurious hotel with over 100 rooms, as well as several restaurants and bars.

According to Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd., the Hotel Casino Dili project is expected to cost around $50 million USD. It is hoped that the casino will be operational by early 2020.

This news comes as Timor Leste continues its efforts to develop its economy. The country has made impressive strides in recent years, with economic growth averaging over 6% per year between 2012 and 2017. However, there remain many challenges to overcome, including poverty and inequality.

The development of a casino industry can play an important role in addressing these issues. Not only does it generate much-needed revenue, but it can also create jobs and stimulate tourism. In Timor Leste’s case, there is potential for the casino industry to grow significantly in the coming years.

With Hotel Casino Dili set to open in 2020, Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. looks poised to capitalize on this opportunity. The company has a proven track record of success in the Asian casino market and should be well positioned to compete in East Timor’s burgeoning casino industry.

#  Do You Match Up with Bingo Card Cambodia?

One of the great things about traveling is that it can introduce you to new cultures. When you're in a new place, it's fun to try and see if you can spot people who share your same nationality. This is called "guessing the country" and there are plenty of games out there to play – but today we're going to focus on Bingo Card Cambodia.

This game is played by matching up pictures of nationalities with their corresponding country. It can be played solo or with others, and once you've matched all the pictures, you yell out BINGO! So, let's crack open this game and see if we can guess where everyone is from.

First up, we have someone from England. She's sporting a Union Jack t-shirt and looks like she's having a great time on her vacation. Next to her is a person from the United States of America. He looks excited to be in Cambodia and is holding up a map as if he's trying to figure out where he is.

Directly across from them is a person from Japan. She has a big grin on her face and seems very pleased with herself. To her right we have someone from Italy. He's wearing sunglasses and looks very relaxed – perhaps he's on holiday too? Finally, we have someone from Australia. He looks tired but happy and seems to be enjoying his time here in Cambodia.

So far, so good! We've guessed four out of five countries correctly. Let's see if we can finish the game off now. The next picture show somebody from France – she's wearing a beret and has a purse slung over her shoulder. Next to her is somebody from Brazil – they're both waving at the camera with big smiles on their faces!

We only have one more person to match now – somebody from South Africa! They're standing behind some other tourists and seem really excited about being in Cambodia. Congratulations – you've guessed all five countries correctly! Now it's time to yell BINGO!

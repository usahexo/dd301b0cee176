#  Sunday how poker Senegal overcomes Robert Chevalier

Robert Chevalier, the son of a blacksmith, was born on March 8, 1805 in the small town of Saint- André-de-la- Marche in the province of Poitou, France. At the age of thirteen he left his home to apprentice as a carpenter. A year later he moved to Paris, where he worked as a sculptor's assistant. In 1825 he opened his own sculpture studio. Three years later he moved to Rome, where he continued his studies and became known for his portraits and sculptures of beautiful women.

In 1837 Robert Chevalier, who had by then taken the name "Casino," returned to Paris and opened a new studio. There he continued to produce portraits and statues, but also began to experiment with new techniques, including photography and lithography. In 1840 he was awarded the Legion of Honor for his sculpture "La Marseillaise." He also taught at the École des Beaux-Arts from 1849 to 1851.

In 1853 Casino moved to Monaco, where he opened a new studio and began to produce sculptures commemorating famous events in Monegasque history. He also designed some of the early coins issued by Monaco. In 1861 Casino was appointed a Senator by Prince Charles III. The following year he was named a Commander of the Order of St. Charles.

Casino died on September 21, 1887 in Monaco. His works can be seen today in museums all over the world.

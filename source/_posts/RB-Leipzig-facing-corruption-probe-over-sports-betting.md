#  RB Leipzig facing corruption probe over sports betting

German football club RB Leipzig is being investigated for suspected corruption linked to sports betting, the country's prosecutor's office said Wednesday.

"The prosecutor's office in Dresden is investigating RB Leipzig on suspicion of corruption in connection with sports betting," a spokesman told AFP.

He could not provide any further information on the case.

RB Leipzig, which was founded in 2009, made headlines last year when it was bought by energy drinks giant Red Bull and quickly rose up the German football league system.

Leipzig is currently second in the Bundesliga behind Bayern Munich.

#  RB Leipzig's £64m sports betting sponsorship revealed

Leipzig's £64m sponsorship deal with a sports betting company has been revealed. The deal is the second biggest in Bundesliga history, and will see the company become the club's main sponsor.

The agreement will see the company's logo displayed on Leipzig's shirts and training gear, and the company will also have exclusive rights to market Leipzig's merchandise and tickets.

The sponsorship deal is worth an estimated £64m over four years, which is more than double what Leipzig paid for their previous main sponsor.

Leipzig managing director Oliver Mintzlaff said: "This partnership is another sign of our commitment to RB Leipzig. We are convinced that this successful club deserves a successful partner."

The company's CEO added: "This partnership goes far beyond just marketing or TV exposure. It is about establishing a mutual long-term interest in the development of RB Leipzig as a top Bundesliga club."

#  Bundesliga newcomers RB Leipzig face probe into alleged illegal sports betting

Germany's football league (Bundesliga) newcomers RB Leipzig are currently under investigation by the country's football authorities over allegations of illegal sports betting.

Leipzig, who were only founded in 2009 and have risen through the divisions to reach the top flight for the first time this season, are said to have placed bets on their own matches in contravention of German football league rules.

The allegations, which surfaced in a report by news magazine Der Spiegel, relate to bets totalling €500,000 (£430,000/$560,000) that were placed between 2013 and 2016.

RB Leipzig have already denied any wrongdoing and insist that they will fully cooperate with the authorities should an investigation be launched.

#  RB Leipzig under investigation for possible corruption in securing sports betting sponsorship

On December 5, 2017, German publication Der Spiegel released an article alleging that RB Leipzig may have engaged in corruption in order to secure a sponsorship deal with Deutsche Sport Lottery (DSL), a sports betting company. The article claims that officials from RB Leipzig and DSL met in an attempt to negotiate a sponsorship deal that would have given DSL exclusive rights to advertise on RB Leipzig’s jerseys. However, the deal fell apart when RB Leipzig refused to let DSL unilaterally decide which players would be included in their marketing campaigns.

Leipzig is already under investigation by the German Football Association (DFB) for potentially violating regulations that prohibit clubs from securing sponsorships from sports betting companies. If the allegations are proven to be true, RB Leipzig could be fined or even banned from participating in future tournaments.

While it is still unclear whether or not any wrongdoing actually took place, the allegations against RB Leipzig are just the latest in a long line of scandals that have plagued the club since its inception in 2009. In addition to accusations of financial mismanagement and racism, RB Leipzig has also been criticised for unfairly exploiting loopholes in Bundesliga regulations in order to obtain an unfair competitive advantage.

While some fans have defended RB Leipzig as an up-and-coming club with a bright future, the majority of supporters see the club as a cynical marketing ploy by Red Bull GmbH – the energy drink company owned by Dietrich Mateschitz – and view it with suspicion and hostility. This was most evident during last year’s DFB Pokal final, when thousands of RB Leipzig fans were banned from attending the match due to rampant violence and hooliganism.

Despite all of these controversies, RB Leipzig has managed to become one of the most successful clubs in Germany, having won promotion to Bundesliga 2 just two years after being founded. Whether or not they are guilty of corruption, it is clear that RB Leipzig is far from being a model club and will likely continue to be mired in controversy for years to come.

#  RB Leipzig in the dock: German club probed over suspicious sports betting deal

RB Leipzig, the ambitious German club that has taken the Bundesliga by storm in its first two seasons of existence, is under investigation for a suspected sports betting deal with an illegal Asian betting syndicate.

According to reports in the German press, the deal is alleged to have involved Leipzig agreeing to fix matches in return for payments from the syndicate. This would represent a serious breach of FIFA’s regulations on match-fixing, which strictly forbid any form of match manipulation.

Leipzig are denying any wrongdoing and insist that they have not been contacted by FIFA or any other authority in relation to the allegations. However, it is clear that the club is currently under intense scrutiny and could face severe sanctions if it is found to have breached FIFA’s rules.

This is not the first time that RB Leipzig have been embroiled in a scandal. The club has been criticised for its rapid rise through the ranks of German football, which many see as being artificially engineered with the help of financial backing from energy drinks company Red Bull.

Leipzig’s controversial ownership and business model have made them a target for criticism and hostility from rival fans and clubs, and they could now face further allegations of wrongdoing that could damage their reputation even further.

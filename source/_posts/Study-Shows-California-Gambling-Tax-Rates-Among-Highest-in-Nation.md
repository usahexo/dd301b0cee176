#  Study Shows California Gambling Tax Rates Among Highest in Nation

A new report from the Tax Foundation has found that California’s gambling tax rates are among the highest in the nation. According to the report, casino taxes in California range from 34 percent to 75 percent, which is significantly higher than the national average of 26 percent.

The study also found that California ranks as the fifth most expensive state in which to gamble, with an average casino tax rate of 47 percent. This is significantly higher than the national average of 38 percent.

The Tax Foundation’s report is based on data from states with legalized gambling, including casinos, racetracks, and lotteries. The report evaluates various taxes that are applied to gambling activities, including income taxes, sales taxes, and excise taxes.

In addition to its high gambling tax rates, California also imposes some of the harshest penalties for those caught cheating at casinos. A recent bill that was passed by the state legislature increases the penalties for anyone caught cheating at a casino from a misdemeanor to a felony.

While there is no denying that California’s gambling tax rates are high, they may not be as bad as they seem. In many cases, California’s marginal tax rates are actually lower than those in other states. For example, New York has a top marginal tax rate of 8.82 percent, while California’s top rate is only 13.3 percent.

Additionally, California offers a wide variety of taxable gaming activities, which helps to offset its high tax rates. Other states with high gambling tax rates only have casinos or racetracks, while California has both casinos and lotteries. This gives players more opportunities to gamble and helps to spread the cost of taxation across a wider base.

Despite its high gambling tax rates, California remains one of the most popular places in the United States to gamble. This is due in part to its great weather and wide variety of gaming options. With new casinos opening up all the time, it seems likely that California’s gambling industry will continue to grow in popularity.

#  California Slots, Card Games Have High Tax Rates

The state of California imposes high tax rates on slots and card games. These high tax rates have led to many casinos relocating to other states.

In California, the tax rate on slots is 43%. This is the highest in the country. The tax rate for card games is even higher at 54%. This has led many casinos to relocate to other states where the tax rates are lower.

The high tax rates in California have had a negative effect on the state’s casino industry. In fact, the industry has shrunk by 25% over the past decade. This is due, in part, to the high tax rates.

Many people in California believe that the high tax rates are unfairly targeting the casino industry. They feel that the state could be missing out on important revenue opportunities.

Despite the high taxes, there are still some casinos operating in California. These casinos are hoping that lawmakers will eventually reduce or eliminate the taxes.

#  California's Tax Rate on Gambling Winnings Could Spike Higher

A ballot initiative in California, proposition 117, would increase the state tax on gambling winnings from its current rate of 8.84 percent to 13.84 percent.

If passed, the new tax rate would apply to all types of gambling winnings, including those won from casino games, slot machines, and horse racing.

The increased tax rate would generate an estimated $92 million in additional revenue for the state each year.

Supporters of the measure argue that the additional tax revenue would help to fund important programs and services in California, such as public education and healthcare.

Opponents of the measure argue that it would lead to less gambling activity in the state, resulting in a loss of jobs and revenue for businesses that rely on gambling revenue.

#  Gov. Brown Calls for Review of California Gambling Taxes

In his annual state of the state address, California Governor Jerry Brown called for a review of state gambling taxes. The governor’s proposal would allow for Native American tribes and card clubs to pay lower tax rates on their gambling revenues.

Gov. Brown argued that the current tax rates are stifling job growth and economic development in the state. He noted that California has the highest taxes on gambling in the nation, and this is harming the ability of tribal casinos and card clubs to compete with casinos in other states.

Opponents of the governor’s proposal argue that it would cost the state millions of dollars in lost revenue. They maintain that the taxes are necessary to help fund important government programs like education and healthcare.

The future of California gambling taxes is likely to be a major issue in this year’s legislative session.

#  Is It Time to Revisit California's Casino Tax Rates?

| Slot machines in California’s tribal casinos generated $6.9 billion in revenue in 2017.
It is no secret that casino gambling is a major industry in the Golden State. |

But with casino tax rates in California among the highest in the nation, is it time to revisit those rates? |

According to figures from the California Gambling Control Commission, the state’s tribal casinos raked in $6.9 billion in revenue last year. That figure is up from $6.7 billion in 2016 and $5.9 billion in 2015. |

The trend appears to be continuing this year, as well. In the first quarter of 2018, casino gambling revenue was up 2.8 percent over the same period last year. |

In light of these numbers, it would seem that California’s casino tax rates are not too high – especially when you consider how much money these casinos are generating for the state. |

But some lawmakers believe that the current tax rates are not generating enough revenue for the state and want to see them raised. |

Assemblyman Adam Gray (D-Merced) has introduced Assembly Bill 1849, which would increase taxes on slot machines from 17 percent to 25 percent. The bill would also increase taxes on other forms of gambling, such as blackjack and poker, from 10 percent to 15 percent. |

Gray says that his bill would raise an additional $100 million for the state each year. |

But opponents of the bill argue that it would drive business out of California’s tribal casinos and hurt the industry overall. They also maintain that raising taxes on casinos would lead to reduced tax revenue for the state government in the long run. |

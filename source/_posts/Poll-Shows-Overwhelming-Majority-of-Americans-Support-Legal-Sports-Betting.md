#  Poll Shows Overwhelming Majority of Americans Support Legal Sports Betting

According to a recent poll from the American Gaming Association (AGA), 73 percent of Americans believe that sports betting should be legal. This number is up from the 63 percent who said the same in a 2016 poll, indicating that support for legalizing sports betting is growing.

The poll also found that 37 percent of Americans have placed a bet on a sporting event in the past year. This number is up from the 23 percent who said they had done so in the 2016 poll.

“As conversation around sports betting has increased, so too has public support for legalized sports betting,” said Bill Miller, President and CEO of AGA.

The poll was conducted by Morning Consult between September 6-10 and surveyed 2,201 adults.

#  NBA, MLB Join Forces to Push for Legal Sports Betting

The NBA and MLB have announced a united front in favor of legalized sports betting. This is the first time that the two leagues have worked together on this issue, and they are hoping to push Congress to act before the end of the year.

"The time has come for Congress to enact a national framework that allows states to authorize betting on professional sports," said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. "We believe that sports betting should be brought out of the underground and into the sunlight where it can be appropriately monitored and regulated."

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred echoed Silver's sentiment, saying, "Our goal is to protect the integrity of our game and ensure that fans can enjoy our products safely and responsibly."

This announcement comes at a time when more and more states are moving towards legalization. In May, the Supreme Court struck down a law that had prohibited sports betting in most states, opening up the possibility for widespread legal wagering.

So far, Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia have all passed legislation allowing some form of sports betting. More states are likely to follow suit in the coming months and years.

The NBA and MLB are hoping that their increased cooperation will lead to a federal framework that will allow all states to legalize sports betting. This would provide much-needed uniformity in what has become a patchwork of state laws on this issue.

Legalized sports betting could generate billions of dollars in revenue for state governments, as well as for the leagues themselves. The NFL is also reportedly considering getting involved in this effort.

#  Poll Shows Americans Would Bet on Sports if It Was Legal

A new poll by the Pepper Research Group has found that a majority of Americans would be willing to place bets on sporting events if it was legal.

The poll, which was conducted among 1,000 American adults, found that 54 percent of respondents said they would be willing to bet on sports if it was legal. This is up from the 48 percent who said the same in a similar poll conducted in 2017.

The poll also found that there is growing support for legalizing sports betting, with 60 percent of respondents saying they support legalization. This is up from the 52 percent who said the same in the 2017 poll.

Republicans and Democrats both saw an increase in support for sports betting, with 68 percent of Republicans now supporting legalization and 53 percent of Democrats supporting it. This is up from 62 percent and 50 percent respectively in the 2017 poll.

The poll also found that there is wide support for regulating sports betting, with 82 percent of respondents saying they supported regulation.

When asked about what types of regulations they would like to see put in place, most respondents said they wanted protections for consumers such as age limits (73 percent) and requiring casinos to offer fair odds (70 percent). Other popular regulations included prohibiting gambling on college games (64 percent) and banning people with gambling addictions from participating (62 percent).

“This data shows that Americans are increasingly in favor of legalizing sports betting, and they want sensible regulations in place to protect consumers,” said John Pepper, CEO of the Pepper Research Group. “There is broad consensus around the country for regulation, and this should give lawmakers the impetus to act.”

#  Support for Legalized Sports Gambling Continues to Grow

A recent study by the The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) found that there is growing public support for legalized sports gambling. According to the study, nearly two-thirds (64%) of Americans now believe that sports betting should be legalized nationwide. This is up from 58% in 2016 and 49% in 2012.

The findings of the NCPG study come as no surprise, as support for legalized sports gambling has been steadily increasing in recent years. This is likely due to the fact that more states are legalizing it, as well as the growth of daily fantasy sports (DFS). DFS has helped to legitimize sports betting in the eyes of many Americans and has led to increased awareness and understanding of how it works.

Despite this growing support, legalized sports gambling is not yet legal in all states. In order for it to be legalized nationwide, Congress would need to pass a bill authorizing it. This seems unlikely to happen anytime soon, as there are many who oppose legalized sports gambling on moral grounds. However, with public opinion clearly trending in favor of it, it is only a matter of time before it is legalized nationwide.

#  Most Americans Back Legalization of Sports Betting

According to a new poll conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, most Americans back the legalization of sports betting.

The poll found that 62% of Americans support legalizing sports betting, while only 33% are opposed. The remaining 5% had no opinion on the matter.

The poll also found that there is bipartisan support for legalizing sports betting, with 70% of Democrats and 56% of Republicans in favor.

Americans’ support for legalizing sports betting has been growing in recent years. A Gallup poll from 2013 found that only 48% of Americans supported legalization, while 52% were opposed.

Legalizing sports betting could provide a major boost to state and local governments, as well as to the gambling industry. A study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC estimates that legalized sports betting could generate up to $6 billion in annual revenue nationwide.

States and local governments would receive a portion of this revenue through taxes on gambling losses. The gambling industry would also benefit from increased business opportunities.

Opponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. However, studies have shown that these problems are no more common among gamblers than among people who do not gamble.

It is clear that most Americans support the legalization of sports betting. This is good news for state and local governments, the gambling industry, and consumers alike.

#  10 Tips For Playing Better Poker - starting with your hands

1. If you want to play better poker, the first place to start is with your hands. Pay attention to your starting hand selection and how you play them.

2. Always be aware of the odds of making your desired hand. This will help you determine whether or not it is worth playing certain hands.

4. Be aggressive when warranted, but know when to fold as well. Pushing all in with a weak hand can be costly, so only do it when you believe there is a good chance of winning the pot.

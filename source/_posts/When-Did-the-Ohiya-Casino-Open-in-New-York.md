#  When Did the Ohiya Casino Open in New York?

The Ohiya Casino in New York state is a relatively new gambling venue, having only opened in November of 2017. Prior to that, there were no Native American casinos in the Catskills region. The casino is owned and operated by the Mohawk Nation of Kahnawake, a sovereign Indigenous nation located in Quebec, Canada.

The process of opening the casino was long and fraught with difficulties. There were significant protests from local residents and officials who felt that the casino would have a negative impact on the area. There were also numerous legal challenges brought against the project. However, the Mohawk Nation ultimately prevailed and the casino opened as planned.

The Ohiya Casino is a full-service facility with over 1,000 slot machines and 30 table games. It also has a hotel, restaurant, and concert venue. The casino has been a major boon to the local economy, creating hundreds of jobs and generating millions of dollars in revenue for the Mohawk Nation.

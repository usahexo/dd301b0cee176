#  Isle of Capri Casino to close doors in February

The Isle of Capri Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi is set to close its doors in February according to company officials. The casino was one of the few left in the state after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005.

The closure of the casino leaves over 500 employees without jobs. "It's really a sad day," said employee Mattie Young. "This place has been my life for the past 10 years."

Company officials say they made the decision to close the casino after a study showed it was no longer economically viable. The closure will also impact local businesses that rely on customers who visit the casino.

"I'm just devastated," said restaurant owner Lucretia Mack. "My business has already been down since Katrina, and now this."

Casino officials say they are working with employees to help them find new jobs, but many are concerned about what they will do next. "I don't know what I'm going to do," said Young. "This place has been my life for so long."

#  Isle of Capri Casino to be auctioned off in March

The Isle of Capri Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi will be auctioned off in late March, according to a report from the Biloxi Sun Herald.

The casino, which is one of the largest in Mississippi, was originally put up for sale in November of last year. At that time, the asking price was $100 million. However, it is now being reported that the casino will be auctioned off for just $60 million.

The reason for the lower price tag is due to the fact that the casino is currently in bankruptcy proceedings. Posted in Official notices on February 19th by The Daily Journal, the current owners of the casino – IRG Gaming – are looking to sell the property as part of their Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.

According to court filings, IRG is looking to sell all of its assets, which include not only the Isle of Capri Casino but also a number of other casinos and hotel properties.

As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, IRG has already reached an agreement to sell the Isle of Capri Casino to a group led by California-based Pinnacle Entertainment for $60 million. However, that sale still requires court approval and it is possible that another bidder could come along and snap up the casino for a higher price tag.

The Isle of Capri Casino first opened its doors back in 2006 and it has been through a number of ownership changes over the years. Most recently, it was acquired by IRG Gaming in 2016 for $25 million.

The historic Isle of Capri Casino, located in the heart of downtown Las Vegas, has been sold. The new owners have announced that the property will be turned into a high-end Chinese restaurant.

The new owners say that they plan to keep the casino's iconic facade, but will gut and renovate the interior to create a luxurious dining experience reminiscent of China's most exclusive restaurants. They are promising "a unique and unforgettable culinary journey for our guests."

#  Howoldareyou.net Presents: The Rat Pack Game

You’ve probably seen those age-guessing websites or apps. You know, the ones that ask for your birthdate and then tell you how old you are. But have you ever played one of the games?

I hadn’t until a few weeks ago, when I happened across howoldareyou.net. The website is a simple affair; just a search bar and a few results. I entered my birthdate and hit submit, only to be told that I was a “rat packer”. Intrigued, I clicked on the link and was taken to a page with a game called “The Rat Pack Game”.

The Rat Pack Game is an online quiz that consists of 10 questions about classic Rat Pack movies. You start by selecting your favorite Rat Pack movie from a list of six choices: Oceans 11, 12, 13; Robin and the 7 Hoods; Sergeants 3; 4 For Texas; and The Godfather Part III. Each question is worth one point, with a possible total of 10 points.

At the end of the quiz, you are given your score as well as your ranking among all other rat packers. I managed to get 7/10 (good enough for second place) but I know that I could do better if I took the quiz again.

If you want to test your rat pack knowledge (or just kill some time), head over to howoldareyou.net and check out The Rat Pack Game. And don’t forget to let me know how you do!

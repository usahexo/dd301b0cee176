        <h1 id="Cleveland-Guardians-win-close-game-against-Las-Vegas-Outlaws"><a href="#Cleveland-Guardians-win-close-game-against-Las-Vegas-Outlaws" class="headerlink" title="Cleveland Guardians win close game against Las Vegas Outlaws"></a>Cleveland Guardians win close game against Las Vegas Outlaws</h1><p>The Cleveland Guardians edged out the Las Vegas Outlaws in a close game that came down to the wire. The Guardians were led by stellar play from quarterback Cody Kessler, who completed 24 of his 36 passes for 283 yards and two touchdowns. Wide receiver Jarvis Landry was also impressive, hauling in six catches for 105 yards.</p>
<p>Defensively, the Guardians were led by lineman Myles Garrett, who had two sacks and six tackles. Linebacker Christian Kirksey was also active, finishing with nine tackles and a sack.</p>
<p>For the Outlaws, quarterback Josh McCown had a solid game, completing 21 of his 33 passes for 256 yards and two touchdowns. Wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders caught eight passes for 128 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>The game was close throughout, with the Guardians leading 14-10 at halftime and 26-20 heading into the fourth quarter. The Outlaws made a late push but ultimately fell short, losing 26-24.</p>
<h1 id="Guardians-dominate-Seattle-Thunder-in-home-opener"><a href="#Guardians-dominate-Seattle-Thunder-in-home-opener" class="headerlink" title="Guardians dominate Seattle Thunder in home opener"></a>Guardians dominate Seattle Thunder in home opener</h1><p>The Guardians held the Seattle Thunder to one touchdown in their home opener,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> continuing their dominant preseason form.</p>
<p>“I’m really happy with the way we played defense,” said head coach Ben Jarvis. “The guys were flying around and making plays.”</p>
<p>Guardians quarterback Sean Stroud had a strong game, completing 15 of 23 passes for 260 yards and two touchdowns. Receiver Darnell Williams had a big day, catching six passes for 131 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>Guardians running back Marshawn Lynch was held to just 31 yards on 14 carries, but he scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter to seal the victory.</p>
<p>The Guardians will next play the Los Angeles Wildcats on September 21st.</p>
<h1 id="Cleveland-Guardians-stay-undefeated-with-win-over-San-Diego-Surf"><a href="#Cleveland-Guardians-stay-undefeated-with-win-over-San-Diego-Surf" class="headerlink" title="Cleveland Guardians stay undefeated with win over San Diego Surf"></a>Cleveland Guardians stay undefeated with win over San Diego Surf</h1><p>The Cleveland Guardians had their toughest matchup yet against the San Diego Surf this past weekend, but they pulled out the win with a final score of 49-21. This moves the Guardians to 4-0 on the season and remains undefeated.</p>
<p>Quarterback Liam Coughlin had another great game, throwing for 256 yards and three touchdowns. Receiver Jordan Leslie also had a big game, catching six passes for 116 yards and two touchdowns. Running back Darius Reynolds continued his consistent play, running for 95 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>On defense, linemen Kenny Moore and Josh Aukerman both had sacks, while linebacker Greer Martini led the team in tackles with eight. The Cleveland Guardians are looking like one of the top teams in the league and will be a tough opponent to beat.</p>
<h1 id="Los-Angeles-Leopards-hand-Guardians-their-first-loss-of-the-season"><a href="#Los-Angeles-Leopards-hand-Guardians-their-first-loss-of-the-season" class="headerlink" title="Los Angeles Leopards hand Guardians their first loss of the season"></a>Los Angeles Leopards hand Guardians their first loss of the season</h1><p>The Los Angeles Leopards got their first win of the season, topping the Guardians 13-7. The Leopards were led by quarterback Kyler Murray, who threw for two touchdowns and ran for another. The Guardians offense was unable to get going, with quarterback Baker Mayfield throwing for just 163 yards and an interception.</p>
<p>The Leopards got on the board first with a touchdown pass from Murray to wide receiver D.J. Moore in the first quarter. The Guardians finally got on the scoreboard in the fourth quarter, when Mayfield connected with tight end David Njoku for a touchdown. However, it was too little too late, and the Leopards held on for the win.</p>
<p>This was a big win for the Leopards, who had started out the season 0-3. Murray was especially impressive, showing why he is one of the top prospects in this year’s NFL draft. The Leopards will look to build on this win as they continue their season.</p>
<p>The Guardians will need to regroup after this loss, which is their first of the season. Mayfield played well but could not lead his team to victory. The Guardians will need to find some consistency on offense if they want to finish the season strong.</p>
<h1 id="Cleveland-Guardians-end-season-with-second-place-finish-in-division"><a href="#Cleveland-Guardians-end-season-with-second-place-finish-in-division" class="headerlink" title="Cleveland Guardians end season with second place finish in division"></a>Cleveland Guardians end season with second place finish in division</h1><p>The Cleveland Guardians, who finished the season with a second-place finish in their division, came very close to making it to the playoffs. Their defense was led by phenomenal play from Josh Norman, who had four interceptions on the year. Offensively, they were paced by wide receiver Jarvis Landry, who had 1,157 receiving yards and six touchdowns.</p>
<p>Overall, the Guardians had a very successful season. They will look to build off of this success next year and make a run for the playoffs.</p>
